# Friendly Parakeet Password Generator

## Description

This utilizes a cryptographically strong random number generator to create a secure password which matches the
user's selected criteria.

Notes:

* Cloned code from the following repo for the basis of this project:

* Researched random generator here, and reworked example code a little:

## Installation

Move files to your root web directory (ex. /var/www/html/) on your web server and visit within your browser. Nothing
else needs to be done as long as you've properly configured your web server. For that, please refer to your
documentation.

## Usage

When the user clicks on the `Generate Password` button, they will be prompted for their password requirements. They can
select characters with a length of 8-128, utilizing any combination of the following: lowercase, uppercase, numeric and
special characters. If the user does not make a selection with the required parameters, they will be prompted to do
so. Upon completion, the user is presented with a randomly generated password within the provided field.
